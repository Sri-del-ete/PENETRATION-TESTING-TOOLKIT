# PENETRATION-TESTING-TOOLKIT

*COMPANY*: CODETECH IT SOLUTIONS

*NAME*: SRINIDHI LALAM

*INTERN ID*: CT04DF450

*DOMAIN*: CYBER SECURITY AND ETHICAL HACKING

*DURATION*: 4 WEEKS

*MENTOR*: NEELA SANTOSH

*DESCRIPTION*: The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a modular Python-based application designed to simulate common offensive security techniques such as port scanning, brute-force password testing, and local network host discovery (ping sweep). This tool brings together fundamental ethical hacking modules into a single interface, allowing users to choose and execute multiple penetration testing actions from one console-based application.

The primary goal of this toolkit is to introduce and demonstrate the essential components of real-world penetration testing in a simplified, understandable, and hands-on way. It showcases how cybersecurity professionals gather reconnaissance, attempt to gain unauthorized access, and map networks during ethical red-team assessments.

Educational Value:
This toolkit reinforces the fundamental techniques in penetration testing:

Reconnaissance through ping sweeping.

Enumeration using port scanning.

Exploitation via brute-force attempts.

It simulates what ethical hackers do during assessments and can be used in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, red-team practice labs, or academic assignments.

📦 Real-World Use Case:
Imagine you’re tasked with assessing the security posture of a small company’s internal network. Using this toolkit:

You run a ping sweep to identify live hosts.

You scan each host for open ports like SSH, FTP, or web services.

You try brute-forcing weak passwords on exposed login portals.

This tool gives you a basic but practical way to perform that workflow without needing complex tools or installations.

🏁 Conclusion:
The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a beginner-friendly introduction to real-world offensive security concepts. While simple, it encapsulates the foundational skills of an ethical hacker: scanning, enumeration, and brute-forcing. For internship tasks, this project proves the student’s ability to combine multiple technical components into a modular tool, showcasing knowledge in networking, cybersecurity, Python scripting, and logical design.
